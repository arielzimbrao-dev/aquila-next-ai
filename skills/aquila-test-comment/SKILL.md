# aquila-test-comment — "How to test" for QA

Project data (tracker, API collection, environment, database, correlation header): the `qa` block of
`docs/ai/aquila.json`; if missing, ask once and propose adding it. `qa.tracker` decides the format:
Jira Cloud, GitHub/GitLab and Azure DevOps accept Markdown; the Jira notes below apply only to Jira.
In a Next.js app the default is **UI steps**: page URL, what to click/type and what must be seen.
Add API calls or database queries only when the change has a Route Handler/API or persisted data and QA
has access to it.

## Audience — golden rules

- **Non-dev QA**: plain language; start by explaining "what it is" in words.
- QA has the app in the test environment, the browser (DevTools allowed) and, when configured, the API
  collection and **read-only** database access. They do not touch code.
- Output **always in Markdown**, inside a ` ````markdown ` block (four backticks, so the inner ` ```sql `
  blocks do not close it). Jira Cloud does not read wiki markup (`h3.`, `{code}`).
- **Simple but complete**: happy path + idempotency/edge cases + expected result + evidence.
- URLs, test users/roles and data **ready to use**, with real routes from the repo; calls and queries ready
  to paste when they apply.
- Cover what users notice: loading/empty/error states, validation messages, mobile width, keyboard-only
  path for the main action, and refresh after a change (data persists).
- A unique correlation id per run (header `qa.correlationHeader`; confirm in the code the accepted
  format — e.g. UUID — and whether it is returned in the response).
- Separate what is **not for QA to validate** and **known non-bugs** (flag off, pending provisioning)
  into `> ⚠️` / `> ℹ️` quotes.

## Before writing

1. Read the ticket: goal, acceptance criteria, risks.
2. Read the task's code (diff): pages/routes, components, Server Actions/Route Handlers, feature flags,
   env/config, tables/columns when data is persisted. **Never invent
   identifiers** — confirm each one in the code.
3. Map each acceptance criterion to a verifiable step. No UI yet → use the API/route or a direct query.

## Structure (in this order)

````markdown
### How to test — <ID>: <short name>

**What it is:** <1–2 plain sentences>.

#### Setup

- Environment: **<qa.environment>** → `<base URL>`. Browser: <recommended>; viewport: desktop and mobile.
- User/role: **<test user>** (<role>). Feature flag: `<flag>` = on.
- (If API/data apply) Collection: **<qa.apiCollection>**; header `<qa.correlationHeader>`; database: <qa.database>.

> ⚠️ **Before starting:** confirm with dev/ops that these are on: `<FLAGS>`, and <preconditions>.

#### Steps

1. Open **`/<route>`** → <what must be visible>.
2. <Click/type …> → <message/state expected>.
3. Reload the page → <the change is still there>.

#### Check in the database (only if data is persisted and QA has access)

```sql
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <correlation or known id>;
```

**Expected:** <concrete result>.

#### Edge cases (empty, invalid input, double click, no permission, mobile)

<what to resend/try and what must still happen>.

> ℹ️ **Not bugs:**
>
> - <known non-bug>.

#### Evidence to capture

- Screenshot of <page/state> showing <expected result> (and the query result, if used).
````

## Content rules

- Always state **what "passed" means** — a concrete result, never "check that it is ok".
- One query per block; placeholders only for QA's own values (`<date>`).
- Jira Markdown: `###`/`####`, `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, `1.`/`-` lists, warnings with `>`; `→`
  arrows; avoid tables.
