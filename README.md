Version **0.4.1**

<!-- aquila-family:start -->
## The aquila family

The same method, one package per stack — each one speaks only its own technology (conventions, lint
plugins, presets). They share the mechanics: the git hook dispatcher (`.aquila-hooks/`, byte-identical in
the three), the CI workflow and the gates, so a NestJS backend and a React or Next.js frontend in the same
repository work side by side. Upgrade them together.

| Package | Stack |
|---|---|
| [**aquila-ai**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aquila-ai) | NestJS |
| [**aquila-react-ai**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aquila-react-ai) | React |
| [**aquila-next-ai**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aquila-next-ai) | Next.js (this package) |
<!-- aquila-family:end -->

## Why aquila-next-ai?

AI agents write code fast. Left alone, they also **skip tests, ignore your architecture, mix Pages and App
Router APIs, ship `"use client"` everywhere, use APIs that don't exist in your Next.js version, open 80-file PRs and burn through your token budget** re-reading the
whole repo.

aquila-next-ai turns any agent into a disciplined teammate:

| Without a method | With aquila-next-ai |
|---|---|
| The agent starts coding straight from a vague prompt | A **spec + 6-section plan**, then a hard stop until you say `plan approved` |
| Tests written after the fact (or never) | **TDD**: failing tests first, minimal code, gates green before "done" |
| Generic React that ignores Next.js idioms | **Official Next.js conventions**, version-aware (v12 → v16, focus on **15 and 16**): Server Components first, Server Actions, caching, a11y |
| Every tool configured differently | **One method** for Claude Code, Copilot and Codex, generated from one config |
| 2,000-line context files loaded on every prompt | **Token economy**: ≤ 3.5 KB always loaded, the rest read on demand |
| Huge PRs approved out of fatigue | **Small-PR directive**: above 30 files (configurable) the agent proposes incremental PRs |
| "Works on my machine" | **Gates** in git hooks and a generated GitHub Actions workflow |
| Docs that rot | **Doc-sync** checks: C4, ADRs and tracks updated in the same task |

## Install in 60 seconds

```bash
npm i -D aquila-next-ai
npx aquila-next-ai init
```

Then ask your agent for **`/aquila-init`**. It reads your codebase, confirms six choices with you and writes
the documentation the agents will rely on. That's it: `/aquila-plan` is ready.

## Sibling packages

The same method, one package per stack — they share the git hooks dispatcher, so they live side by side in
one repository (e.g. `backend/` + `frontend/`):

| Package | Stack |
|---|---|
| [`aquila-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aquila-ai) | NestJS (backend) |
| [`aquila-react-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aquila-react-ai) | React |
| [`aquila-next-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aquila-next-ai) | Next.js (this package) |

## What lands in your project

`init` scaffolds the full AI structure, versioned with your code so teammates **and cloud agents** get it
on clone:

## One method, three agents

## The methodology

### 1. Spec-Driven Development → Test-Driven Development

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R([Request / ticket]) --> P["/aquila-plan<br/>spec.md + plan.md"]
    P --> H{"You:<br/>plan approved?"}
    H -- adjust --> P
    H -- yes --> T["aquila-tests<br/>failing tests"]
    T --> I["aquila-implement<br/>minimal code"]
    I --> G{"gate ci<br/>green?"}
    G -- no --> I
    G -- yes --> V["aquila-review<br/>diff review"]
    V --> D([You commit])
```

**Why it works for AI:** models are excellent at following a precise contract and poor at guessing intent.
The plan is that contract (scope, files, test strategy, docs to update), and the human checkpoint stops the
most expensive failure mode: confidently building the wrong thing. Failing tests first give the agent an
objective "done" signal instead of its own opinion.

### 2. Four specialised roles

| Role | Job | Never does |
|---|---|---|
| `aquila-plan` | Turns a request into a self-contained plan | Write production code |
| `aquila-tests` | Writes the failing tests from the plan's cases | Touch the implementation |
| `aquila-implement` | Minimal code to make tests pass, golden-file style | Expand scope |
| `aquila-review` | Ranked findings: correctness, layers, tests, docs, Next.js, PR size | Approve its own work |

Separating roles keeps each prompt small and focused, and the reviewer judges the diff, not the intent.

### 3. Next.js conventions, version-aware

Agents read the project's **installed Next.js major** (it's stamped into `AGENTS.md`) and router, and apply
[`core/nextjs.md`](core/nextjs.md): Server vs Client Components and where the `"use client"` boundary goes,
data fetching and caching, Server Actions with validation and authorization, Route Handlers, `next/image`/
`next/font`, accessibility and Core Web Vitals, env and security headers, testing with Testing Library and
Playwright. Version notes cover the changes that trip agents up — async `params`/`cookies()` and the caching
defaults flip in v15, `proxy.ts`, `"use cache"` and `next lint` removal in v16 — so the agent **never uses
an API newer than your project**.

### 4. Golden files and a context map

Instead of long style guides, `docs/ai/golden.md` points to one exemplary file per type (controller,
service, spec…). Agents copy proven patterns from **your** codebase. `docs/ai/CONTEXT.md` is a map: the
agent opens only the section a task needs, and **code always beats docs** when they disagree.

### 5. Quality gates, everywhere

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    E["edit"] --> PC["pre-commit<br/>format · lint"]
    PC --> PP["pre-push<br/>typecheck · test · lint-aquila"]
    PP --> CI["CI · aquila-gates.yml<br/>all gates + check"]
```

Gates are detected from your `package.json` scripts (`typecheck`, `test`, `lint`, `format:check`,
`test:cov`, `build`, `test:e2e`) — no new tooling to learn. On top, **lint levels** (`off` / `standard` / `high`) add a
catalog of principles, each mapped to its Sonar rule and enforced with ESLint.

### 6. Token economy

What every agent loads on **every** prompt is capped; everything else is read on demand. These are the
default budgets `npx aquila-next-ai check` enforces (characters):

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Default context budgets (chars) — enforced in CI"
    x-axis ["AGENTS.md", "per-folder rule", "golden.md", "copilot-instr.", "project skill", "CONTEXT.md"]
    y-axis "max characters" 0 --> 15000
    bar [3500, 2500, 6000, 8000, 10000, 14500]
```

Before any task that reads the whole codebase, agents run `npx aquila-next-ai tokens` and **ask for approval**
when it would exceed 20 % of your monthly limit.

### 7. Small PRs by design

PRs above `review.prMaxFiles` changed files (**30** by default, set at `init`) get split: the plan proposes
increments, and the review flags oversized diffs with a concrete split (by layer, route segment or plan step).
Reviewable PRs mean real reviews — not rubber stamps.

## Commands

### Agent commands

Claude Code and Copilot: `/aquila-…` · Codex: "aquila-plan …".

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/aquila-init` | Sets up config, docs, CI, hooks and agents from the current state |
| `/aquila-plan` | Request → `spec.md` + `plan.md`, then stops for approval |
| `/aquila-execute` | Runs an approved plan: failing tests → code → gates → review |
| `/aquila-review` | Reviews a diff/PR (also code not written by the agent) |
| `/aquila-docs` | Generates/updates `CONTEXT.md`, golden files, per-folder rules, C4 |
| `/aquila-adr` · `/aquila-c4` · `/aquila-guideline` | Decisions, architecture diagrams, multi-ticket tracks |
| `/aquila-test-comment` | "How to test" steps for QA |
| `/aquila-audit` · `/aquila-deep-audit` | Method adoption audit · deep product audit (security, contracts, errors…) |
| `/aquila-config` · `/aquila-doctor` | Change settings · diagnose and fix the install |

### CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npx aquila-next-ai init [flags]` | Install: config, templates, `.aquila/`, adapters, CI workflow, hooks |
| `npx aquila-next-ai sync` | Regenerate `.aquila/`, routers, settings and CI from `aquila.json` |
| `npx aquila-next-ai check [--ready] [--verbose]` | Schema, links, budgets, drift, hooks/CI location · strict local readiness |
| `npx aquila-next-ai gate <pre-commit\|pre-push\|ci>` | Run a phase's gates; prints only failures |
| `npx aquila-next-ai doctor` | Installation diagnostics |
| `npx aquila-next-ai lint [rules|matrix] [--fix] [--baseline]` | ESLint at the configured level · rule status · fixes · legacy baseline |\|matrix]` | ESLint at the configured level · rule status |
| `npx aquila-next-ai tokens [paths…]` | Estimate tokens to read a scope |

`init` flags: `--lang=en|pt-BR|pt-PT` · `--tools=copilot,claude,codex` · `--token-limit=<n>|none` ·
`--mode=local|team` · `--lint=off|standard|high` · `--pr-max-files=<n>` · `--code-lang=…` (default: detected) ·
`--hooks=dispatcher` · `--install` (lint plugins). Every command takes `--help`.

### Claude Code plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./.aquila
claude plugin install aquila@aquila-next-ai --scope local
```

(`--scope project` in team mode.) `npx aquila-next-ai doctor` reminds you if it's missing.

## `local` vs `team` mode

| | `local` | `team` |
|---|---|---|
| `.aquila/`, docs, config, CI | versioned | versioned |
| Routers (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, Copilot) and settings | generated per machine | versioned — cloud agents and AI PR review get them |
| New teammate | `npm install && npx aquila-next-ai init` | same (hooks are per clone) |


<!-- aquila-monorepo:start -->
## Monorepo / project in a subfolder

aquila-next-ai works when the Next.js project is not the repository root (`repo/backend`, `repo/apps/web`…) and next
to the other aquila packages (e.g. `repo/backend` with aquila-ai + `repo/frontend` with aquila-react-ai). Run
`npm i -D aquila-next-ai` and `npx aquila-next-ai init` **inside the project folder**; everything git, GitHub and Copilot read
is written at the repository root:

```text
repo/
├── .aquila-hooks/            ← one hook dispatcher for the whole repo (core.hooksPath = .aquila-hooks)
│   ├── pre-commit  pre-push  ← same bytes in every aquila package, versioned 100755
│   └── projects              ← "aquila-ai backend" / "aquila-react-ai frontend" — one line per project
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/aquila-gates-backend.yml       ← per project: working-directory, paths: backend/**
│   └── instructions/
│       ├── aquila-backend.instructions.md ← Copilot rules scoped to backend/** (applyTo, generated)
│       └── backend-<area>.instructions.md ← per-folder rules from /aquila-docs, applyTo: 'backend/src/<area>/**'
├── backend/                  ← NestJS + aquila-ai (.aquila/, docs/, AGENTS.md…)
└── frontend/                 ← React + aquila-react-ai
```

- **Hooks:** a repository has one `core.hooksPath`, so every aquila package writes the same dispatcher
  (`# aquila-hooks v2`; a package never downgrades a newer one). On `pre-commit` it runs `<package> gate
  pre-commit` only in projects with staged files; on `pre-push`, only in projects touched by the pushed commits —
  with the package found in the project's `node_modules` or hoisted to the root (npm/pnpm workspaces).
- **Executable bit:** `init` records the hooks as `100755` in the index (Windows does not); `check` fails when
  they are versioned `100644`, which Linux/macOS clones would never run.
- **CI:** GitHub reads `.github/workflows` only at the root: each project gets `aquila-gates-<folder>.yml`
  there. Tests that need a database? Declare `ci.services` (e.g. `postgres:16`) and `ci.env`. Already have a
  pipeline? `ci.workflow: false` — `doctor` prints the two steps to add to it.
- **Done ≠ CI:** `done.gates` lists what the agent must leave green, independent of `hooks.ci`.
- **Husky or another manager?** `init` keeps it and tells you to call
  `"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.aquila-hooks/pre-commit"` (and `pre-push "$@"`) from it, or migrates with
  `init --hooks=dispatcher`. A `core.hooksPath` whose folder is gone or has no hooks is migrated with a warning.
- **Per-folder rules:** Copilot reads `.github/instructions/` only at the root, so `/aquila-docs` writes them
  there as `<folder>-<area>.instructions.md` with `applyTo` prefixed by the folder; `check` counts them for
  coverage and budget.
- **Claude Code:** each project enables its own plugin in its `.claude/settings.json` (team mode, written by
  `init`/`sync`): open the session in the project folder and Claude Code offers it. To install it by hand,
  `doctor` prints the exact command (`cd "<project>" && claude plugin … --scope local`, which leaves the
  versioned settings untouched).
- **Verify:** `npx aquila-next-ai doctor` (subfolder, dispatcher, registered projects, bin found, workflow) and
  `npx aquila-next-ai check` (fails when hooks or the workflow sit where git/GitHub never read them).

Upgrading: upgrade **all** aquila packages of the repository to the same minor, then run `init` in each
project and commit `.aquila-hooks/` and the workflows.
<!-- aquila-monorepo:end -->

<!-- aquila-legacy:start -->
## Adopting in a legacy project

`init` reads what the project already has before proposing anything:

- **Gates:** a check-only script (`lint:check`, `lint:ci`, `format:check`…) is preferred; a script that fixes
  files (`--fix`, `--write`) never becomes a gate — in a hook it would change files mid-commit.
- **Coverage:** the thresholds already in `jest.config` / `vite.config` / `vitest.config` are used, not aquila's
  default. With a `coverage` gate, CI does not also run `test` (the suite would run twice).
- **Language:** the identifiers' language is detected (`language.code`; `--code-lang=…` to choose), and
  `--lang=pt-BR|pt-PT` writes the `docs/` indexes in that language.
- **Lint plugins:** at `--lint=high`, `init` prints the exact `npm i -D …` with versions that work together
  (or installs them with `--install`); `doctor` checks the installed versions. They are optional
  `peerDependencies` of aquila-next-ai.

Then, so existing violations don't block every commit:

```sh
npx aquila-next-ai lint --baseline   # records today's violations in docs/ai/lint-baseline.json — commit it
```

From then on `lint-aquila` fails only on **new** violations (ESLint bulk suppressions, ESLint ≥ 9.24); run
`--baseline` again after fixing to shrink the file. Rules that clash with the project are tuned per rule
instead of lowering the whole level:

```json
"lint": { "level": "high", "overrides": { "curly": "off", "max-lines-per-function": ["error", { "max": 120 }] } }
```

### Compatibility with the project's own ESLint

`lint-aquila` loads plugins (sonarjs, unicorn…) the project's own ESLint may not have. An
`// eslint-disable-next-line sonarjs/…` for an aquila rule then fails there ("Definition for rule … was not
found") or, with `reportUnusedDisableDirectives`, is reported as unused and deleted by `--fix`. Add the helper
as the **last** item of the project's `eslint.config`:

```js
import { aquilaEslintCompat } from 'aquila-next-ai/lint/eslint/compat.mjs';

export default [...yourConfig, aquilaEslintCompat()];
```

It drops only those two directive messages, and only for rules of aquila's catalog: the project's own problems,
fixes and stale directives of its other rules stay (keep `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` on). `doctor` warns when
the project has an `eslint.config` without it. Rules whose autofix can break the build are reported with a
suggestion, never rewritten by `lint --fix` (`unicorn/prefer-at`: `.at(-1)` is `T | undefined` without
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`).

### Standing instructions and the definition of done

A standing instruction like "commit after every change" goes in `workflow.autoCommit`: `true` or `"commit"`
(commit, push only when asked) or `"commit+push"`, so the generated `AGENTS.md` doesn't contradict it. Gates the
agent must leave green but that only your own pipeline runs (e.g. tests that need Postgres) go in `done.gates`:
`doctor` no longer reports them as "never runs".
<!-- aquila-legacy:end -->

## Updating

```bash
npm i -D aquila-next-ai@latest
npx aquila-next-ai sync
npx aquila-next-ai check
```

`sync` refreshes `.aquila/`; review and commit the diff. CI fails if `.aquila/` drifts from the installed
version, so the team always runs the same method.

## Requirements and limits

Node ≥ 22, Git, a Next.js project. Zero runtime dependencies. aquila-next-ai guides and automates checks; it does
not guarantee defect-free code or that every model obeys every rule — that's why the human checkpoint and the
gates exist.

## Contributing

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`core/contributing.md`](core/contributing.md). Tests: `npm test`.
Releases: push a `vX.Y.Z` tag matching `package.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; the release workflow
publishes to npm.
